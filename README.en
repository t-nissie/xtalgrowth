xtalgrowth is an X application which simulate crystal
growth of 2-dimensional hard spheres. If you execute
xtalgrowth, a window opens, hard spheres fall from random
positions, and they stacks at the bottom of the window.
You can adjust growth conditions with command line options.
You will get calculated results as PostScript files from
stdout (standard output) in a certification-like form (Fig.1).
xtalgrowth is suitable for demonstrations of computer
simulations of materials science, for example, in
museums or at open campus events.

Usage:
 $ xtalgrowth --help
 $ xtalgrowth -d 0.033 -c 3
 $ xtalgrowth -d 0.033 -c 2
 $ xtalgrowth -d 0.015 -c 1
 $ xtalgrowth -g 'Mr. Takeshi Nishimatsu' | lpr
Put certification.eps in the current directory to get a certification letter.
certification.eps will be used as a title of the certification letter.
Name of the guest given with -g option and today's date will also be on the certification letter.
The string given with -g option will be also used as a seed for a pseudo random number generator.

If your printer cannot print xtalgrowth's output correctly,
pipe it through gs command:
 $ xtalgrowth [OPTIONS...] | gs -q -sDEVICE=pswrite -sOutputFile=- -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH - | lpr

== Homepage and DOWNLOAD
Home page of xtalgrowth is http://loto.sourceforge.net/xtalgrowth/ .
Latest tar.gz package (xtalgrowth-X.Y.Z.tar.gz) can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/loto/files/xtalgrowth/ .

== Compilation and installation
Requirements are
 * C compiler (gcc)
 * X11  libraries and their include files
 * popt libraries and their include files (apt-get install libpopt-dev or see http://rpm5.org/files/popt/ )
If you have all of them, You can generate src/xtalgrowth with
 $ tar zxf xtalgrowth-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
 $ cd xtalgrowth-X.Y.Z
 $ ./configure
 $ make
Test the executable
 $ cd src
 $ ./xtalgrowth --help
 $ ./xtalgrowth
If you want to install /usr/local/bin/xtalgrowth,
 $ sudo make install

In some 64 bit systems, you may get link errors like
 /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so when searching for -lX11
In this case, give some LDFLAGS in the configure step
 $ ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib64"

== Calculation conditions and results
Periodic boundary condition is employed
for x-direction (width of the box).
Collision detection of hard spheres is rough.
This computational roughness results in defects of crystals.

It starts from periodic substrates.
If diameter is tight, you will not get perfect stacking:
 $ xtalgrowth -d 0.033333
You can give the diameter of hard spheres with ration to the box width.
Loose diameter and slow falling velocity may result in perfect stacking:
 $ xtalgrowth -d 0.033 -v 0.0001
You can change criterion of stacking with -c option from 3 to 1.
If -c 3, hard spheres stops falling when it touches 3 other spheres:
 $ xtalgrowth -d 0.033 -c 3
If -c 2, hard spheres stops falling when it touches 2 other spheres.
Defects will be included in the crystal:
 $ xtalgrowth -d 0.033 -c 2
If -c 1, you will get fractal structures (See Reference [1]):
 $ xtalgrowth -d 0.01 -c 1
Name of the guest given with -g option will be used in the PostScript file
of certification letter from STDOUT. The string given with -g option is also
used to generate 2 positive integers by hashpjw.c. Using that two integers
as seeds, uni64.c generate pseudo random numbers (See Reference [4,5]):
 $ xtalgrowth -g 'Mr. Takeshi Nishimatsu' > takeshi.ps

You will get a help message with a "--help" option
 $ xtalgrowth --help
if you compiled with the popt library.

== Display
